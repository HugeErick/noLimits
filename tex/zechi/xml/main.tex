\section{Theoretical Framework}
XQuery is a powerful and flexible query language designed for querying and transforming XML data. It is often referred to as "SQL for XML" due to its ability to extract and manipulate data stored in XML documents. XQuery is built on XPath expressions and provides additional features such as FLWOR (For, Let, Where, Order by, Return) expressions, which allow for complex data retrieval and transformation tasks \cite{w3}.

One of the key strengths of XQuery is its ability to handle hierarchical and nested data structures, which are common in XML documents. This makes it particularly useful for applications such as web services, data integration, and content management systems. For example, XQuery can be used to extract specific elements from an XML document, transform the data into a different format, or generate reports based on the data \cite{microsoft}.

Another important feature of XQuery is its support for strong typing and schema validation. This ensures that the data being queried adheres to a predefined structure, reducing the risk of errors and improving the reliability of the queries. Additionally, XQuery supports modularity, allowing developers to create reusable modules and functions that can be shared across different projects \cite{w3schools}.

\subsection*{Goals}
The goal of this lab is to have a first encounter with the XQuery language to examine XML
documents.

\subsection*{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{BaseX}
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
The methodology involves writing and executing XQuery scripts to perform the operations on the XML documents. Each query is designed to demonstrate a specific feature or use case of XQuery, such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and transforming data. The results of each query are analyzed to understand the underlying principles and techniques.

\section{Query Results}
Below are the XQuery scripts and their corresponding results:

\section{Conclusions}
Through this exercise, we gained a deeper understanding of the XQuery language and its capabilities in querying and transforming XML data. The practical examples demonstrated the flexibility and power of XQuery in handling complex data retrieval and manipulation tasks. Future work could explore advanced features such as XQuery functions, modules, and integration with other technologies, will ORACLE save us from a painfull dev experiencie with XML?

\section*{Our Team experiencie with AI on the activity}
We as a team were unable to implement the solutions that the artificial intelligence tried to provide because they still need to mature on archaic technologies, and because this technologies are used in the laboral field, the information of methodologies of using such technologies are not in the range of ChatGPT's or any other AI database.
